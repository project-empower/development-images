Images used to work on Project Empower

Please do all development from a container to ensure that all tools we ourselves find useful to work on the system are available to system users.  In other words, the very first image I made was the one I used to initialize and push this repository.  I don't have git installed to tempt me into using it.  The only assumption that can be made is that the container system is installed--currently that is Docker.
